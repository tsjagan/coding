1. Constant time random access hash implementation
2. Efficient elevator API
3. Ransom note
4. Median of k unsorted arrays
5. Design of a task scheduler
6. Custom comparator
7. Given an array of Ints find a maximum sum of non adjacent elements.
   For ex. arr = [1,0,3,9,2] then ans would be 10 = 1 + 9 (non adjacent element) 
8. Expression evaluation
9. Maximum subsequence
10.Overlapping meeting times
