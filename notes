- Throughput:
   Maximum rate of productions/processing. this is the maximum number
   of requests that can be processed in a unit of time.

- Latency:
  Time required to process a single request (response time)

- IOPS:
  IO operations per second = ( 1 / (latency+seek time) of the disk).
  - Here latency is the time it takes for the sector of disk to rotate
    into position under the head (rotational latency).
  - Seek time is the time it takes for the head to come under correct track.
